# My Mission
Since dating apps become one of the mainstream tools for connecting human being, but these apps still don't give any chance to our pets to make new friends.<br>Pets are always used as human accessories or even as a method for dating. Therefore I created the app to serve the pets, all the user information is about the pets, not about his/her/its owner.<br>
